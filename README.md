# Image Restoration using Ising Model
## UCSD PHY 242 Final Project

#### Image processing with Matlab code
- Use matlab code `binarize.m` to binarize the image (colored or grayscale)
- Run `make` to run simulation
- Run second section matlab code obtain the comparison between images

#### Use Graphics Interface
- One must have the Qt library to compile and run Qt codes
- use `Qt creator` to open the `Ising.pro` file
- Debug and run it
